# Todo Console App

A feature-rich console-based todo application built with Python and Rich for beautiful terminal output.

## Features

### Core Features
1. ✅ Add Task (title + description)
2. ✅ View All Tasks (with status indicators)
3. ✅ Update Task (modify title/description)
4. ✅ Delete Task (by ID)
5. ✅ Mark as Complete (toggle status)

### Enhanced Features
- Rich terminal UI with colorful output and formatted tables
- JSON persistence with backup system
- Loading animations and confirmation dialogs
- Session Management (save and resume work context)

## Session Management Feature

This application includes a powerful session management system that allows you to save and resume your work context:

### Session Commands

- `stop [session_code]` - Save your current todo state with a session code
- `start [session_code]` - Resume a saved session by its code
- `sessions list` - Show all saved sessions
- `sessions delete [session_code]` - Delete a saved session
- `sessions info [session_code]` - Show detailed information about a session

### Session Auto-Detection

When you start the app, it will automatically detect if any sessions exist and prompt you to resume or start fresh.

### Session Code Requirements

- Must be alphanumeric only (a-z, A-Z, 0-9)
- No spaces or special characters allowed
- Length: 1-50 characters

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.13+
- Rich library for beautiful terminal output
- PyFiglet for ASCII art
- Emoji for icons
- UV package manager
- JSON storage with backup system

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Python 3.13+ and UV installed
2. Install dependencies: `uv sync`
3. Run the application: `uv run python src/main.py`

## Architecture

The application follows a clear separation of concerns:
- `src/models.py`: Data structures (Task class, etc.)
- `src/storage.py`: File I/O operations (JSON persistence and session management)
- `src/todo_manager.py`: Business logic for task and session management
- `src/ui.py`: Rich UI components and terminal output
- `src/main.py`: CLI entry point and menu interface
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests

## Success Metrics

- All 5 core features working
- Enhanced UI with Rich components
- JSON persistence with backup system
- Session management functionality
- Code generated by Claude Code only
- Clean spec history maintained
