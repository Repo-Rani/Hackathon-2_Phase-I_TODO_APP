# Todo Console App

A simple command-line todo list application that stores tasks in memory during a single session.

## Purpose

This is Phase I of the "Evolution of Todo" hackathon project using **Spec-Driven Development**.

## Features (Basic Level Only)

1. ✅ Add Task (title + description)
2. ✅ View All Tasks (with status indicators)
3. ✅ Update Task (modify title/description)
4. ✅ Delete Task (by ID)
5. ✅ Mark as Complete (toggle status)

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.13+
- UV package manager
- In-memory data structures (lists/dicts)

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Python 3.13+ and UV installed
2. Install dependencies: `uv sync`
3. Run the application: `uv run python src/main.py`

## Constraints

- No persistence (data lost on exit)
- No external dependencies
- CLI interface only
- Single-user (no authentication)

## Architecture

The application follows a clear separation of concerns:
- `src/models.py`: Data structures (Task class, etc.)
- `src/todo_manager.py`: Business logic for task management
- `src/main.py`: CLI entry point and menu interface
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests

## Success Metrics

- All 5 features working
- Code generated by Claude Code only
- Clean spec history maintained
- Demo video under 90 seconds
